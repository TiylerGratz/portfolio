## Description: A game made for a week long game jam with the theme "Random Chance". In this game, the player can use a slot machine to determine their character build. It takes tokens to run the machine so they cannot infinitely spin it. The slot machine gives effects such as double jump, increased melee damage, etc. With these effects, the player then enters a combat. Every round exponentially more enemies spawn in, each one killed increases the player's score and gives them tokens. The player's goal is to get as high of a score as possible.

## Description: A game intended to inform users on the current state of the snow leopard population. The user plays as a snow leopard in a platformer representing a mountain. The player must hunt and eat goats in order to survive. With every passing day, humans begin to show up in the mountains. They build farms, lower the wild goat population, and see snow leopards as threats. When a human sees a snow leopard, they will shoot and try to kill them. The player must explore and get food while avoiding getting killed by the humans. This game mirrors how in real life, snow leopard populations are in danger due to humans moving into their territory and then killing snow leopards when they hunt lifestock.
